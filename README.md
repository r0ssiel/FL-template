# Forbidden Lands Template
This repository contains a LaTeX template (document class) for making documents similar to the Forbidden Lands books. Don't use this template for comercial purpuses. Its only intended use regards free content made by the community to the community.

Please, feel free to modify the file for your personal needs, such as changing the paper size or the chosen hyphenation language. That said, the above still stands: do not use it for commercials purposes.

## Example file: Cheat Sheet in Portuguese
The example provided in this repository is that of a cheat sheet of Forbidden Lands rules translated to Portuguese. This cheat sheet is mostly the one first conceived by [u/gypsyfreak](https://www.reddit.com/user/gypsyfreak/), which you can still acess [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/tzlk67/for_any_forbidden_lands_fans_i_made_this_player/). I made small changes to the file due to: 
1) personal taste regarding which rules I found to be most important;
2) LaTeX formatting shenanigans.
